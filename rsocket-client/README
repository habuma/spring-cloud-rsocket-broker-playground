This is a simple spring-cloud-rsocket broker client. It acts as a client to 
another client that acts as a service (if that makes any sense). It establishes
a connection to the broker, which relays the connection request to the other
client which acts as the service. It then reacts to events published by the
service. 

Run with:

$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
